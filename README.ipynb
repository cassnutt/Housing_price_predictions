    "For this project, I wanted to look through the data for pertinent information for first time home buyers. I explored home sales prices and used linear regression to build a model that could predict home prices for the area. My goal of the model was to build one that would accurately predict housing sale prices and see which features have the biggest impact on price."

    "* Increasing the size of your home will increase the value. For every square foot of living space, one could expect an extra \\\\$110 on the sale price.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding square footage to the lot does increase the value of property- about .32 or .54 cents for every square foot. That may not sound like a lot of money, but we kept lots that were up to 750,000 square feet. That can add up if the property has a lot of land."
